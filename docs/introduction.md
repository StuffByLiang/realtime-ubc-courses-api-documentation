Hey! I'm guessing you're here because you wanna develop a cool application, whether it be for your personal repertoire or for a local hackathon. Well, we're glad you're using this api.

The UBC Realtime Courses API was developed in the hopes of making course data easily available to all developers. Any data imaginable on the ssc courses site - this api has it all. And the most important part of it all? This API can retrieve data in REAL-TIME. Woah.

### How does this API work?

We essentially scrape the UBC ssc courses site for you when you make a request. This is extremely useful if you want to obtain information regarding a course's **registration numbers** to determine **course availability**. If you don't need realtime data, no worries! We also **cache** all our data.

### Are we worried about breaking the terms of use of the SSC site?

Not at all, because we're not breaking it. Section (f) Access and Interference states that you may not impose an "unreasonable or disproportionately large load on UBCâ€™s infrastructure. An "unreasonable or disproportionately large load" is one that prevents other members of the University community from gaining fair and equitable access to web-based systems and resources." By these standards, we are not breaking the terms of use of the SSC site.

Well? What are you waiting for? [Get Started!](gettingStarted)
